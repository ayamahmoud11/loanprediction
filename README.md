# Loan Prediction System

## Overview

The Loan Prediction System is a Python-based application designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various factors. This machine learning project utilizes a dataset to train and evaluate predictive models, assisting in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze and visualize data to gain insights into patterns and trends.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models using the processed dataset.
- **Prediction:** Use trained models to predict loan approval outcomes for new applications.
